## Notes on Chart and Filtering Features

In my experience, it is crucial to provide the ability to share charts and filtering states. This feature allows users to easily:

- Share specific charts or filtered results via platforms like **Slack**.
- Add direct links to specific filters or charts in documentation tools like **Confluence** or other collaborative platforms.

### Implementation
This capability has been carefully considered and implemented during development to ensure:
- **Deep Linking**: Charts and filtering states are reflected in the URL, making them sharable.
- **Reproducibility**: Shared links always lead to the same filtered data or chart view, ensuring consistency.

This makes the application not just a tool for exploration but also a resource for collaboration and documentation within teams.

3. **Interactive Chart Filtering**:
   - Click on any portion of a chart to navigate to the card section, which will be pre-filtered based on your selection.

## How to Start

### Option 1 (Recommended): Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn
    ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
    ``` 

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

    ``` 

## Future Work

### UI Enhancements
- **Better UI**: Improve the overall look and feel.
- **Responsive Design**: Currently optimized for wide screens (1600px width). Needs adjustments for smaller screens.
- **Custom or Ant Design**: Finalize between fully custom styles or sticking to Ant Design. (Would have used Tailwind if more time was available.)
- **Fix Chart Issues**: Address spacing issues, such as in `RaritySection.tsx`.

### Functionality Improvements
- **Filter Fixes**: Resolve filtering issues, e.g., cannot filter to "Energy" in the card list.
- **Boxplot Navigation Error**: Fix the navigation bug in the boxplot section.

### Technical Updates
- **Linting**: Add or fix the linter configuration.
- **Better Typing**: Improve TypeScript typing across the project.
- **Fix Path Imports**: Normalize imports (e.g., `@` vs `.`).
- **Inline CSS**: Minimize and fix instances of inline CSS.
- **Unit Test**: Add more unit tests

### Deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate deployment to GitHub Pages on commits to `main`.
- **SEO Updates**: Update meta information for better search engine optimization.
- **nginx**: Fix nginx redirect issue.
