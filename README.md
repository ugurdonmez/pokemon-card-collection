Future work
- better ui

- fix github action to deploy gh-pages when commit to main
- cannot filter to energy in the list
- inline css
- update favicon
- update seo information
- responsive desing (I have quite wide screen so I usualy work the done in w:1600px h:1600px, I do not have time to fix small screen)
